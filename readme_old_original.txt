My friend (thanx Stodi) encouraged me to do something similar to the Matrix
animation. I knew that falling letters were to simple. There are many such
anims. I looked for something else, something more interesting.
When I was lying in bed some idea appeared in my head. I realized that it
would be good, and not so hard to do.
And here You have this idea translated into programme.

3D Clock is very simple model. It consists of several boxes and cylinders. But
in "Matrix World" this thing looks more complicated...

Unfortunately I persuade You not to view this in resolution less than
640x480. The rule is simple: the bigger resolution the better animation is
( more details are seen ).

The code is like a hybrid. Some of code is obtained from S3dE, but it is only
for matrices transformation, and wire frame drawing. The rest is new...

There is also some interaction with the User:

ESC   - exit
F1    - show/hide fps counter and my logo
F2    - enter "the Fen Mode" :)
HOME  - get screen shot and save it in file "scr_shot0.pcx, sr_shot1.pcx..."
SPACE - pause animation ( clock is still ticking, and letters are changing )

 - I Added some thinks fe. "The Fen Mode"...
 - In this distribution I give You a Matrix screensaver ( resolution: 1024x768 )

Thats all...
